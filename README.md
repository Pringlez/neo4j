###### Semantic Web and Linked Data - Exercise 7
# Neo4j
In this exercise we will look at the graph database Neo4j.

## Introduction

1. NoSQL is the umbrella term for databases that do not conform to the relational, SQL-style model.

1. Relational database queries usually result in table joins, some of which can be very costly.

1. NoSQL databases can avoid costly join, to achieve certain results much more efficiently.

1. Two common NoSQL database types are Document-oriented and Graph.

1. Neo4j is a graph database.

1. Graph databases store data in the form of nodes, that are connected through relationships.

1. Nodes can have properties, and relationships can have properties.

1. Relationships have types, and are directed.

1. Labels group nodes into sets.

1. Neo4j uses a language called Cypher for querying.
